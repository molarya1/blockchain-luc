# TAGS

[TAGS](https://tags.hawksey.info/) is a free Google sheet that allows you to basically do what we've just done--scrape data--but without all of the coding work.

To access TAGS:  
1\. Click on [Get TAGS](https://tags.hawksey.info/get-tags/), then click on Tags v6.1  
2\. Click “make a copy”    
A copy of the TAGS Google sheet should now be in the Google drive.  
3\. On the sheet, click on the **TAGS tab**, then select **Set up Twitter access** to connect your Google sheet to your Twitter account.  
4\. Follow the prompts until you have access (i.e. keep clicking “allow” and then sign into your Twitter account)  
5\. Once you are connected, enter a term or hashtag that you would like to search for on **line 9**  
6\. Go to **TAGS → Run now!**  To run a search on your term  
7\. Then, click on **Archive** (bottom tab) to see the data you have collected

What information did you just collect?  How do you imagine using this kind of data?  
Why did you make us do all of that work when could have just used TAGS?!?!
