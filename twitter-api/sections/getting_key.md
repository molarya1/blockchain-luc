# Getting Your API key

1\. Join [Twitter](www.twitter.com), if you're not already a member. Be sure that your instructor/administrator has your Twitter handle (@whatever), as this will be used to invite you to the CTSDH developer account.\
2\. You should receive an email inviting you to the CTSDH Twitter Developer account.  Click on "accept invitation." \
3\. Fill out the form. You will be asked for a website, but note that Twitter doesn't check if it's a real website or not as long as it's in this format: http://www.xyz.com \
4\. You'll be redirected to a new screen that shows the name you entered for your application. Click the tab at the top that says "Keys and Access Tokens"  
5\. You'll see your Consumer Key and Consumer Secret, which look like long strings of letters and numbers. Copy them to an empty text file on your computer. Make sure to note which is the Key and which is the Secret!  
6\. Nearly done! While still on the "Keys and Access Tokens" page, scroll all the way to the bottom and click the "Create My Access Token" button.  
7\. Under the "Your Access Token" heading, copy the Access Token and Access Token Secret and put them in the text document. You should now  have four numbers: Consumer Key, Consumer Secret, Access Token Key, and Access Token Secret.
